Software Assignment: Document Pagination in Tiptap Editor
You are allowed to use any AI tools given that you understand what AI wrote.
Objective
Design and build a Tiptap-based document editor with real-time pagination that shows users exactly how their legal documents will appear when printed.
This assignment evaluates your ability to:
* Solve a specific, scoped technical problem end-to-end
* Work with rich text editors and understand content measurement challenges
* Build something production-ready that we could ship to customers
* Understand how you use AI in your daily coding to get things done
Deadline: One week after the task is given 
Follow-up: Code and product review discussion with the team
Background
OpenSphere builds legal workflow tools for immigration professionals. One core feature allows users to draft legal documents (cover letters, petitions, support letters) within our platform using a Tiptap-based rich text editor.
Our customers have requested a key feature: the ability to see page breaks within the editor as they write. When drafting a multi-page letter for USCIS submission, users need to visualize exactly how content will appear when printed, so they know what falls on page 1 vs. page 2, and so on.
Think of how Google Docs or Microsoft Word shows page boundaries as you type. We want something similar for our editor.
Scope of Work
You will build a functional Tiptap editor with pagination. The application should:
1. Display Visual Page Breaks
   * Show distinct pages in the editor as the user types
   * Page breaks should update dynamically as content is added, deleted, or pasted
   * Clear visual separation between pages (similar to word processors)
2. Match Print Output
   * US Letter size (8.5" x 11") with standard 1-inch margins
   * What users see in the editor should match what prints
   * This matters because documents are submitted to USCIS and formatting is important
3. Support Standard Formatting
   * Headings, paragraphs, bold/italic text, bullet points at minimum
   * Page breaks should calculate correctly with mixed content types
4. Handle Edge Cases Gracefully
   * Long paragraphs that span pages
   * Content reflow when editing mid-document
   * Varying line heights from different formatting
5. Optional Enhancements
   * Page numbers
   * Print/export to PDF functionality
   * Header/footer support
   * Table support with proper page break handling
Recommended Technology Stack
* Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
* Editor: Tiptap
* Backend: Node.js (if needed)
* Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or similar

Pagination-Specific Research
Pagination in rich text editors is a known challenge. Some directions worth exploring:
* How content height is calculated in the DOM
* Tiptap's node views and how to measure rendered content
* Approaches other editors (ProseMirror, Slate) have taken for pagination
* CSS paged media concepts
We're not prescribing a solution. Part of this assignment is figuring out an approach that works.
Deliverables
* Working prototype (live link)
* GitHub repository with clear setup instructions in README
* Brief write-up (can be in README) explaining:
   * Your approach to calculating page breaks
   * Any trade-offs or limitations
   * What you would improve with more time
* For the interview call: prepare to explain your thought process and walk through your code
